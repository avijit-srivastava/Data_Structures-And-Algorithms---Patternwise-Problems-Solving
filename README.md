# Data_Structures-And-Algorithms---Patternwise-Problems-Solving

## 📌 About
This repository is created as part of my learning journey to understand **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in a **pattern-based approach**.  
I am sharing it publicly so that others can also refer to it, learn from it, and practice along the way.

The main goal is to:
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Identify common DSA patterns
- Build strong fundamentals for coding interviews

## 📂 Repository Structure
Problems are organized **pattern-wise**, making it easier to recognize and apply the right approach.

Example patterns include:
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Binary Search
- Recursion & Backtracking
